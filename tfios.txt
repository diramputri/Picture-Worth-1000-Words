
The Fault in Our Stars is a novel which tells the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16 year old girl who has had cancer for three years, and Augustus Gus Waters, a 17 year old boy who is now in remission, and once had a tumour in his leg. The two fall hopelessly in love, even though they know their story will only end in heartbreak.

Hazel Grace Lancaster has not experienced the awkwardness that is teenage life in three years after being diagnosed with cancer when she was thirteen. Forced by her mother, Hazel Grace reluctantly goes to a cancer support group to meet others who supposedly understand what she is going through.

This bland and truly miserable support group is where she meets the charming, charismatic and unremarkably handsome Augustus Gus Waters, an amputee whose optimism towards life interests Hazel. Gus becomes immediately attracted to Hazel and, though the feeling is mutual, Hazel knows that their love is doomed from the start.

However, Gus still charms Hazel. He changes her life by giving her, as she states: Forever within the numbered of days and changing her attitude towards life.

The two travel to Amsterdam to search for the author of their favourite book, An Imperial Affliction, where their relationship blossoms and they learn that life, with or without cancer, is hard to face in general, and sometimes those who advise you to make daring and impulsive choices cannot always pluck up the courage to make their own.

Their little infinity reminds you that even the most heart-wrenching love story can be poetic, intelligent, humorous and full of positivity, even when you know there is no chance of ever having a fairy-tale ending.

John Green (also the author of bestsellers Looking For Alaska, An Abundance of Katherines and Will Grayson, Will Grayson) breaks your heart in the best possible way, and makes you cry, laugh, and smile throughout. Though he writes in an upbeat and light-hearted manner, you can still sense the Hazels annoyance at life, which is endearing, as even though Hazel Grace is forced to be mature for her age, you can see she is still just a grumpy, moody teen.

With a movie set to be released in June, Hazel and Gus have already captivated millions of hearts with their inspiring and engaging story. Even though many books have been cheapened by the movie, you can sense just by the trailer that this movie will live up to its expectations.

Shailene Woodley, an award winning actor, and newcomer Ansel Elgort, will star as the love-sick teens. I hope that they will portray the characters truthfully and honestly.

The Fault in Our Stars is one of those books you cannot stop reading, yet you never want it to end. It is warm, light-hearted and deals with a sensitive topic like cancer in such an understated and subtle way. You feel it is just one of many life problems and, even though it is a very serious matter, Hazel and Gus teach you that you cannot let an illness like cancer affect your love for life.

This book is precious. It tells you that you cannot give up even when something is trying to stop you from enjoying a happy life. It is a rare book that is emotional and full of light.

The Fault in Our Stars is something that will appeal to everyone, as it pulls on your heart strings and makes you giggle. But most importantly, it makes you think about how valuable love is, how short a life can be, and how just one person can change your life in the most simple way.
