A friend/data science mentor introduced Shannon entropy to me. He's pretty cool, so I wanted to be cool like him: Studying information theory and entropy in data science. Built with Python, because I have too many projects in R!

[Problem Set](https://danielpimentel.github.io/teaching/CS6980/MPs/MP4/CS6980_MP4_InfoTheory.pdf) - some friends of mine at Georgia State University took CS 6980, which is how I found out about this mini project. Seems like fun :)
