# Picture-Worth-1000-Words

A friend/data science mentor introduced Shannon entropy to me. He's pretty cool, so I wanted to be cool like him: Studying information theory and entropy in data science. Built with Python, because I have too many projects in R!

Goal: Compare the entropies of a text sample and a picture. My text sample is a summary of "The Fault in Our Stars" by John Green. The picture is a screenshot from "All of the Stars" by Ed Sheeran, which happens to be the main song of the book's movie adaptation.

To do list:

* Function for entropy calculation for text

* Function for image analysis
